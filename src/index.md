A collaborative effort to organize Matlab tools for the Oceanographic Community

## Time Series Tools

- [UTide](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/46523--utide--unified-tidal-analysis-and-prediction-functions?requestedDomain=www.mathworks.com): Expands and integrates the t_tide (Pawlowicz et al 2002), r_t_tide (Leffler and Jay 2009), and "versatile" (Foreman et al 2009) approaches into a common framework. From Dan Codiga.

- [jLab](https://github.com/jonathanlilly/jLab): A Matlab toolbox for big data analysis, signal processing, mapping, and oceanographic applications. From Jonathan Lilly.

- [RPSstuff](https://github.com/rsignell-usgs/RPSstuff): Tools for principal axis, low-pass filtering, z0tocd, and more.  From Rich Signell. 

- [Bobstuff](https://github.com/sea-mat/bobstuff): Tools for vector correlation and more.  From Bob Beardsley. 

- [rwt](https://github.com/ricedsp/rwt): Rice Wavelet Toolbox. 

- [timeplt](https://github.com/rsignell-usgs/timeplt): Gregorian labeling of stacked time series plots, including vector stick plots. From Rich Signell. 

## Numerical Modeling Tools
- [seagrid](https://github.com/rsignell-usgs/seagrid): Orthogonal curvilinear grid creator for Matlab, used to make grids for ROMS, COAWST, ECOM, etc.

## Mapping Tools
- [m_map](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~rich/map.html): A free mapping package. From Rich Pawlowicz. 

## Hydrographic Tools
- [teos-10](http://www.teos-10.org/software.htm): Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater (e.g. practical salinity, specific volume, potential density, etc). 
- [ez-krig](http://globec.whoi.edu/software/kriging/easy_krig/easy_krig.html): A gui-driven collection of routines to make Kriging of hydrographic and other spatial data a simple process, by Dr. Dezhang Chu.
- [lim](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~rich/#LIM): Tools for water properties in lakes (or seawater < 4 ppt). From Rich Pawlowitz.
- [dynmodes](https://github.com/sea-mat/dynmodes): DYNMODES calculates ocean dynamic vertical modes. From John Klinck. 
- [woce-tools](https://github.com/sea-mat/woce-tools): A collection of WOCE water property data utilities. From Paul Robbins. 
- [FloatAxis](http://www2.mar.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/ocean/epsonde/programming.html): Plot data with different units (eg. temperature, salinity and density versus depth) on the same axes having the x-axis for the parameters "floating" below. The number of parameters plotted is not limited. From Blair Greenan.
- [tsg-gc](http://www.ird.fr/us191/spip.php?article63): A tool for interactive quality control of sea surface temperature and salinity. From IRD.

## Data Interface Tools
- [nctoolbox](http://nctoolbox.github.io/nctoolbox/): Provides read-only access to NetCDF, OPeNDAP, HDF5, GRIB, GRIB2, HDF4 and many (15+) other file formats and services using the same API.  Understands and utilizes CF Conventions to facilitate reading coordinate data (lon, lat, depth, time). 

## Atmosphere
- [air-sea](https://github.com/sea-mat/air-sea): Compute surface wind stress and heat flux components from buoy and shipboard atmospheric and near-surface oceanographic time series measurements. By Rich Pawlowicz and Bob Beardlsley.

## Other Tools
- [moordyn](http://canuck.seos.uvic.ca/rkd/mooring/moordyn.php):Tools for designing and testing dynamics of oceanographic moorings and towed bodies. From Richard Dewey.
- [tide_ell](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/347-tidal-ellipse): Tidal ellipse tools that convert between u and v amplitude and phase parameters and tidal ellipse parameters (major axis, ellipticity, inclination and phase). There is also a program to estimate vertical profiles of tidal ellipse parameters, given sea-elevation gradients. From Zhigang Xu.
